                        <!--<p>For me it all started nearly 30 years ago, I was 8 or so and my dad (who was a
                              programmer) thought it would be a good idea to get me coding. To that end, he decided I
                              should write a program each week. Though they were simple Basic programs it really gave
                              me my start. In college, was a finance major, the curriculum required every student to
                              take some IT courses, so I took VB6 which was the standard teaching language at the
                              time. I was amazed how well I took to it. Other students were constantly in the
                              instructors office, not me, it just came so easy.</p>-->

                        <!--  <p>At this point I decided to switch my major, having already completed much of the
                              requirements for a business degree, I elected to switch to Management Information
                              Systems. It is true, most developers have a comp-sci background, but I feel that the
                              business degree has served me well. It made it pretty easy for me to relate to users,
                              understanding their needs and concerns.</p>-->

                        <!-- <p>After college, I went on to become a Coldfusion (CF) developer, though it was pretty easy
                              to get up to speed on, I soon realized that this particular language was a dead end.</p>-->

                    <h3>University of Central Florida</h3>

                    <p>After I got a few years of CF development under my belt, I took a position as a project
                        manager for a team of CF developers. In this role I learned a lot, I was responsible for
                        the production of my team for better or worse. I stood up for my people when they were
                        right, and taking the heat when they were not. I learned to judge talent, hiring people
                        and, unfortunately, sometimes letting people go, always learning as I went. As things
                        went along, and foreseeing that there would soon be little work for my team in the CF
                        ecosystem, I began to migrate them to asp.net and C#. There were ups and downs,
                        particularly resistance to change and the change from a dynamically typed, procedural
                        language such as CF to the static typed object oriented C#. In time we made the change,
                        and along the way I also learned C#. Given that I also knew the new language and was
                        eager to get my hands dirty, I began to contribute code as well as leadership to the
                        group. I took responsibility for infrastructure type work like authentication,
                        authorization, data access and so on.<Strong> – NOTE Speak more on the DOD stuff --</Strong></p>

                    <p>Eventually, I wanted to get more involved with the day to day development. My official
                        responsibilities as the PM did not allow for this. At the same time, I was really
                        interested in moving to Colorado so I could be involved in all the great outdoor
                        activities. After a bit of discussion with the family, we decided to relocate. I took a
                        position as a senior developer beginning on a maintenance team at Graebel. During that
                        time, I played a key role in the re-development of one of their major applications
                        tracking the movement of goods around the globe. After this work was released, the team
                        lead got a promotion, and I was asked to take over many of her responsibilities,
                        including working closely with the broad user-base, leading daily stand ups, and
                        planning (with our analyst) for the upcoming sprints. During this time, I coded less,
                        spending more time making sure things got done, tracking velocity, and on boarding new
                        team members.</p>

                    <h3>Graebel Companies</h3>

                    <p>The next step in my career soon came (still with Graebel), I was offered the opportunity
                        to become part of the greenfield development team. I joined an existing team consisting
                        of five of perhaps the most talented developers I have ever worked with,. During this
                        time I switched from web forms and WCF to MVC and REST. This was an extremely exciting
                        time, and I took the opportunity to learn as much as humanly possible. I was a member of
                        a team that gave me the opportunity to help develop the enterprise Api (using WebApi)
                        tying our many desparent systems together through the data warehouse, domain driven
                        design concepts, messaging, and an enterprise service bus. I also had a big role in
                        development of the consuming enterprise portal, joining the data from all the systems
                        together into a consolidated system for our users. Eventually, the organization decided
                        to expand their use of Oracle, eliminating our project.</p>

                    <h3>Toolwatch</h3>

                    <p>My next position was to be with a small company that specialized in asset tracking. Their
                        current app was a .net 2.0 winforms app, that was getting a bit long in the tooth. My
                        task was to develop a RESTFul api and the rest of the server-side components to support
                        their upcoming IPhone app. I dove in, developing a RESTful Api conforming to Level 3 of
                        the Richardson Maturity Model using WebApi. The Api I provided is simple yet elegant.
                        Though the Ios app itself is on its third re-write now, the api I provided remains the
                        standard.</p>
